# TikTok data

## Notes

You'll need to have a Chrome profile that's already logged into TikTok. You can either...

1. Set up a Chrome profile locally - TikTok might prevent you from doing so as you've logged in too many times.
   And the blocking seems to be IP-based and it takes a while.
2. Copy your existing Chrome user data directory (go to `chrome://version`) here, then remove the profiles you
   don't need and change the folder name of the one you wish to use to `Default`
